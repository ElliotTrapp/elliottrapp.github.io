As is typical, RMTransit's video is engaging, entertaining, thought-provoking and well produced. The video provides an overview of what the Regional Connector project is, why it's important to the future of transit in LA, as well as some concerns the author has about the project, particularly in relation to LA Metro's capacity for future growth and expansion. On the whole, I think this video does an excellent job covering the Regional Connector project, but it's important to consider what RMTransit posits as the "bad" parts of the project. I think if we take a closer look, we'll see how this video helps elucidate that there are actually both good and bad "problems" for a transit system to have and why being clear on this difference matters.</p><h1>Capacity and the Regional Connector</h1><p>One of RMTransit's main concerns is that the Regional Connector and LA Metro more broadly isn't future-proofing its development, in that it's not building infrastructure to ensure it can handle a sudden surge of increased capacity. On some levels I share this concern. It's particularly appropriate to raise this in a place like LA where we have such a massive discrepancy between density and the capacity of our public transit system. In Chicago, it probably doesn't make sense for the CTA to plan investments too heavily around the unlikely scenario of a sudden surge in demand. In LA, on the other hand, there is a lot of latent demand that can be tapped into.<br><br>On the other hand, LA is very different. We have a massive population with very <i>very</i> few people utilizing our transit system. It's feasible to expect someday Metro, the city, and the county would get their act together and transit demand would pick up and start to snowball and suddenly we'd have the transit demand of a Portland or Seattle with a transit system that can't meet that demand. In other words, RMTransit is essentially saying that we should build out capacity the right way now, so we don't have to pay to fix them down the road, which is an incredibly common sense position to take. The three brand-new stations that Metro is opening with the Regional Connector are built to serve three-car trains. <em>THREE.</em> In the second largest city in the United States, after spending billions of dollars, what do we have to show for it? Dinky little trains.<br><br>The problem is, just like with induced demand and all things transit, common sense often leads us astray. Having a transit system that is mismatched with a location's demand is a problem, no doubt. But the problem of too large a transit system and not enough demand is not comparable to having too small a transit system and too much demand. These problems are not the inverse of one another and should not be made equivalent in anyway. The difference between these two classes of problems are what I would call "bad problems" (too little demand and too much supply) vs. "good problems" (too much demand and too little supply).</p><h1>Bad Problems</h1><p>Urbanists are all too familiar with vicious cycles - a phenomenon that can be seen in many systems, where an undesirable design characteristic is unintentionally introduced and leads to a decline in the overall health of the system. A classic example is the funding model for public transit in North America. When ridership decreases, governments often use this as a justification to slash funding for transit, which leads to poorer service, which in turn leads to fewer riders, and so on - creating a vicious cycle that is hard to break. To prevent this from happening, it is important to recognize the danger of these 'death spirals' and take steps to avoid them at all costs. The ultimate goal of large infrastructure projects is and should be to support and encourage virtuous cycles that will benefit the system in the long run.</p><h1>Good Problems</h1><p>What makes vicious cycles so dangerous and virtuous cycles so enticing? Momentum.<br>Imagine an LA where whenever a train pulled into a station it was overflowing with people. Imagine it was difficult to find a seat on the bus. Would these be frustrating scenarios for us on an individual level? Undoubtably. But these would be signals that the transit system is growing, in demand, and needs more investment. It would signal that the system, as a whole, is actually healthy, and provide the momentum a place like LA needs to start taking transit seriously. We need to stop thinking so myopically from such a limited perspective. In a world where I can't find a seat on the A line, it's only a matter of time before that problem resolves itself. All the people who miss and train and can't find a seat will get frustrated and pressure there local governments and municipalities to fix the problem. Every time their employer has an employee who is late because she couldn't catch a train, that employer will remind the city how much it relies on it's public transit. Imagine the pictures! The internet would be inundated by random pictures of a packed full expo line with captions that read "how am I supposed to ride this!" or "build bigger trains!" - oh what a joyous day that would be! These are the problems an urbanist Angeleno's dreams are made of.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><ul class="footer__nav"><li><a href="https://www.nationearth.com/" class="invert" target="_blank">Earthlings</a></li></ul><div class="footer__copy">Elliot</div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://elliottrapp.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://elliottrapp.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
